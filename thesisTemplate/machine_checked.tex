\chapter{Machine Checked Schulze Properties}
\label{cha:machine_checked}
 There are various criteria on which we measure the voting scheme. It was not until the pioneer Arrow who proved 
 that a preferential voting scheme can not have all the properties (Arrow Paradox). 
 
 
 Schulze method comes very close to fulling many criteria set by voting experts; however, 
 it can not full fill all because of Arrow paradox. In
