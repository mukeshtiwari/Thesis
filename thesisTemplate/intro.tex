A democracy can be best describe as a system where every participant 
has equal right to express his opinion(s) on different matters. Each
eligible participant expresses his opinion, and a winner is elected 
by using some method to combine every participant's opinion.
In current context of democratic elections, 
every eligible participant expresses his opinion on a paper, also 
known as ballot, 
by marking a tick against the preferred candidate 
(first-past-the-post) or ranking the candidates in some order
(preferential voting). 
One of the most fundamental assumption during any democratic 
election, privacy and anonymity about the voter's choices, was not the case 
in past. It was Victoria, Australia who first introduce the 
concept of secret ballot in 1856 \footnote{
 https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/25532676?q\&versionId=30761831}
 \footnote{https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/
	  resources/secret-ballot-introduced} and gradually, it 
	  got adoption all over the world. Before 1856, Victoria
	  and NSW held their elections to elect its 
	  democratic representative in pub where it was legal for 
	  candidates to offer beer to voters to influence their 
	  decision! 
	  
Verifiability or transparency is other fundamental assumption for 
any democratic election. Transparency insures that each step of 
of election process is easily understood and can be scrutinize by 
every stake holders e.g. voters, political parties, and external 
observers. Privacy and verifiability  is basic 
ingredient for coercion free election, i.e. people 
can express their opinion with any concern, and at the same time,
they can not sell their votes. Without privacy and verifiability, 
we can not expect a true democracy.

 Electronic voting is very different from paper ballot election. 
 Reasoning 
 about privacy and verifiability and many other properties 
 in paper ballot election 
 is straight forward, but we can not do the same for 
 electronic voting election. The reason is, electronic voting constitutes 
 of various untrusted component of software
 \footnote{Unix operating system has 15 million code which can not 
 trusted at all} and hardware
 \footnote{Intel has many undocumented instructions in its x86 
 processor. https://github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/sandsifter} which 
 exposes a large attack surface. These attack surfaces could 
 potentially be exploited for illegal gain in election. 
 Even though electronic voting is gaining popularity, none so far has 
 addressed the software bug issue in electronic voting context. 
 Most of the software used in electronic voting process are 
 inadequately tested which evidently can not rule out all 
 the possibilities.

 \textbf{Properties of electronic voting protocols}
  How should we measure the quality of electronic voting protocol. 
  What is a good voting protocol ? 
  The agreed upto consensus in electronic voting research
  community is or commonly sought properties are  
  [http://www.lsv.fr/Projects/anr-avote/PUBLIS/DKR-jcs08.pdf]
  [Receipt free secret ballot elections Jose Benaloh paper]
  
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Privacy 
 \item Verifiability
 \item Uncoercibility
 \item 
 \end{itemize} 

\textbf{Properties of Electronic voting} 
 Some properties commonly sought forvoting protocols are the following:–Eligibility: Only legitimate voters can vote, and only once.–Fairness: No early results can be obtained which could influence the remain-ing voters.–Individual verifiability: A voter can verify that her vote was really counted.–Universal verifiability: The published outcome really is the sum of all thevotes.–Vote-privacy: The fact that a particular voter voted in a particular way isnot revealed to anyone.–Receipt-freeness: A voter does not gain any information (areceipt)whichcan be used to prove to a coercer that she voted in a certain way.–Coercion-resistance: A voter cannot cooperate with a coercer to prove tohim that she voted in a certain way.
 
 
 \textbf{Motivation and Thesis Statement}:
 [The motivation is that there are plenty of work in symbolic model, but so far no one has 
  tried to implement the algorithm in theorem prover and prove its properties. There are some 
  work by Carsten, Dirk, Flory, and Milad]
  
 Electronic voting has gained a lot of attention in recent year,  and  there are extensive work which 
 addresses the different issues related to electronic voting protocols  in symbolic model, 
 but there are very few, to the best of my knowledge, 
 which has used theorem prover to implement the voting protocol (counting algorithm)
 and verify its correctness properties. 
 \cite{10.1007/978-3-540-31987-0_14}, and  \cite{Delaune2010} have used pi-calculus to model 
 and analyse various properties, fairness, eligibility, vote-privacy, receipt-freeness and coercion-resistant,  
 of the protocol FOO developed by \cite{10.1007/3-540-57220-1_66}.  \cite{Backes:2008:AVR:1380848.1381255}
 presented a general technique to model  remote electronic 
 voting protocol and automatically verifying  its security properties using pi-calculus. 
 \cite{5992139} have used pi-calculus to analyse the ballot secrecy of \cite{Helios:2016:HVS}.
 \cite{10.1007/978-3-642-28641-4_7} have used pi-calculus to ascertain the properties of 
 Norwegian electronic voting protocol.
 \cite{10.1007/978-3-319-68687-5_7} have used Tamarin  to prove receipt-freeness 
 and vote-privacy of Selene voting protocol \citep{Selene}.  Most of these work differs from ours
 in the sense that their primary focus is verification of security protocol in  
 Dolev-Yao model or  complexity-theoretic model, whereas our work is 
 more focused on verified implementation and  verifiability  aspect of election.
[Note to myself: Cartauditable correctness of implementations
 
 The closest to our work is \cite{DeYoung:2012:LLV}, \cite{Pattinson:2015:VCM}, \cite{Pattinson:2016:MSP},
 \cite{Verity:2017:FVI:3014812.3014845}, and \cite{Ghale:2017:FVS}.  \cite{DeYoung:2012:LLV} 
 used linear logic\citep{GIRARD19871} to model the different entity in electronic voting as a resource. 
 The use of linear logic makes it very natural to capture the different entities in electronic voting  
 depending on their usage by means of modality e.g. a voter can cast only one vote, but he might 
 need to show his photo id to multiple times at counting booth. \cite{Pattinson:2015:VCM} treated 
 the process of vote counting from
 the perspective of mathematical proof. They used (mathematical) proof theory to model the 
 counting. \cite{Ghale:2017:FVS} have formalized the single transferable votes in Coq and 
 extracted a Haskell code from the formalization. The extracted Haskell code produces the result 
 and a certificate on a given set of input ballots. The certificate can be used by any third party to verify 
 or audit the outcome of election result.  However, none of these work considers the encrypted ballots, 
 and they simple count on plaintext ballot. Our work 
 
 
 
 
   
 but there are very few or almost none, to best of my knowledge, 
 which has used theorem prover to implement the counting algorithm 
 and verify the its correctness properties. 
 [Reference: Flory Verity, Milad's work on STV, may be more ].
 
   
 After inspecting the current state of art in electronic voting, we 
 asked ourselves two questions
 1. Can we engineer a system which is formally verified to 
    guarantee the correctness property, and practical enough
    to count the real life election involving millions of ballots ? 
 2. Can we decouple the verifiability from implementation i.e. 
    generating enough evidence so that any independent auditor can 
    verify the outcome of election. ? 
  
 
 of 
 the software used in the election process is verified, but just
 tested. One of the most natural question to ask is that 
 can we trust the result if software is buggy, or a more fundamental, 
 
 
 
 why should we trust the result produced by a software even 
 if it's formally proved correct ? This thesis is an attempt to 
 explore these question by using Schulze method as a case study.

\section{Motivation and Problem Statement}
 \fix{What is the motivation behind this research ? Clearly state your \
      Problem statement}
	      
  Before I start diving deep into explaining the bits and pieces 
  of electronic voting, Schulze method, and Coq theorem prover, 
  I still need to persuade the reader that why this thesis 
  exists in first place ?  Why did I choose to certify Schulze 
  algorithm in Coq given the fact that it is not used in 
  any democratic election and Coq is not serious business
  in certifying the software used in electronic voting.  
  Probably, this is the only time where I would unearth 
  the philosopher inside me and go to length to explain 
  the implication of my work. 
  
  
       
%  Well, the honest answer is that  I want to graduate (hopefully), but
%  it's still not convincing argument because I could have chosen 
%  some other project and graduate. 
%   
  [Motivate should refer to some past research, but none of 
  them address the problem of bugs in software.  
  
  On the serious note, the motivation
  behind this thesis to find the answer of question:  
  
  Can we afford bugs in software used for vote counting, and 
  can we engineer a system which has all the "desirable properties" ?
  
  We would answer the

\section{Outline of the Chapters}
%
%Given that I am 
%computer scientist by profession, I would not try to justify my decisions by excessive use of philosophical 
%arguments, but at this point it seems very apt to first investigate this question from philosophical point. 
%
%
%
%The answer depends on how you perceive democracy.  For a dictator, probably  bug in the 
%vote software would be a natural choice, among many others,  to rig the election. If you firmly believe 
%in democracy and democratic values, then 
%among many other things, transparency and bug freeness in vote counting software  would also be 
%in your agenda. There is no doubt that technology can play a critical role in maintaining the democratic values, 
%but assuming that it is the only factor would be a gross mistake. 
%In Azerbaijan's 2013 election, the running president Ilham Aliyev launched a iPhone app, to boost the 
%credibility of election, which enabled the citizens of Azerbaijan to 
%track the tallies as counting took place. There was just one problem. The app already showed that 
%Ilham Aliyev elected before even a ballot was counted.  In this particular case, technology merely helped in 
%surfacing the problem, but it did not do any other thing.  More often technology can be used to hide 
%the transparency of system than making it evident specially in corrupt society for personal gain. 
%
%
%Democracy is a complex system of different actors interacting with each other in certain fashion.  How to make 
%these interaction more productive and better for society, I leave this to political scientists and social scientist
%to figure out, and I stick to my job as a technology enabler.  This thesis is  my journey 
%(with my supervisor) about finding  a way to make vote counting software more robust and transparent.



\section{Why Schulze ?}
\label{sec:thesisstatement}
Even though Schulze method is not used in any democratic election, we settled down 
with it because it is interesting  and at the same time, non-trivial. 
 Schulze's method [cite Schulze]  elects  a single winner based on 
preferential votes.  At the same time, Arrow's impossibility theorem [cite Arrow]  states that no preferential voting 
scheme can have all the desired properties established by  social choice theorist,
the Schulze's method offers a good balance. Many of these properties are already 
established in his original paper. These properties are Non-dictatorship,  Pareto,  Monotonicity, 
Resolvability, Independence of Clones 

I will discuss some of its properties in next chapter. 


A  quantitative  comparison of voting methods 
[cite An Optimal Single-Winner Preferential Voting System Based onGame Theory]  also shows that 
Schulze voting is better (in a game theoretic sense) than other, more established, systems.  The 
Schulze Method is rapidly gaining popularity in the open software community, and It is one of the most 
popular voting protocol over internet to elect candidates. At of 22 July 2019, Wikipedia entry on Schulze 
method [cite Wiki entry] shows at least 70 users, and some of 
notable users among them are Gentoo Foundation, Debian, GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG), Ubuntu, and 
Pirate Party in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Germany, Iceland, Italy, 
Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, and United States.
