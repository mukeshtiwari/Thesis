This thesis could not have been possible without the support of my supervisor, Dirk Pattinson. I really admire his 
ability to understand the problem, and his intuition to to make sure that I stay clear from many dead ends which 
I would have happily spent months. I wish
I could incorporate more of his qualities, but I believe I have less optimism about my chance.
