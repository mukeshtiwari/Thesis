This thesis could not have been possible without the support of my supervisor, Dirk Pattinson. I really 
admire this abilities and intuition to make sure that I stay clear from many dead ends. Moreover, 
I thank him for patiently answering my stupid questions happily and guiding me towards the right 
answer by asking the right questions. My only wish to be researcher like 
him and incorporate more of his qualities, but I am less optimistic about my chance. 

I also want to thank my dog Turbo who would patiently listen to my proofs
and ideas about my PhD with occasionally barking at me if he was bored of listening. He truly made my PhD a breeze, 
and I never felt pressure of PhD when I was walking with him. 

I want to thank Optus, Australian Mobile Service Provider, for launching unlimited calling scheme to India. 
Because of this scheme, I was able to talk to my mom everyday by normal call because she does not know how 
to operate a smart phone. 
 
Some of the great friends who made this journey possible are Caitlin D'Abrera, Milad Ketab Ghale Ali,  Jim De Groot, 
Ian Shillito (my occasional philosophy discussion partner), Ali Cheraghian, and Ahmad Attarha. Although, 
 their lunch time adult jokes were too much for me to digest, but I enjoyed it whenever I could.  
 
 I learned many valuable things 
 from Micheal during the thesis presentation which helped me shaping my personality and how to present it. 
 
 I want to thank Thomas Haines, my co-author,  for teaching me all the bits pieces of cryptography. I really 
 enjoyed working with him. 
 
 One of the best experience of this PhD was travelling to Princeton to participate in summer. 
 Unfortunately, I could not attend Marktoberdorf because it was impossible for me to get the visa of Germany, but I hope
 things would be more easier in the upcoming future. 
 
 Last and above all, I want to thank Mina. Being by your side for the last two years has been the best thing that ever happened to me, and I could not 
 imagine life without you.   I am also grateful to all the efforts you made to bear my tendencies to constantly
  talk about set-theory/formal-verification/every-thing-except-romantic.

 Last, but not least, the good wine and beer of Australia could not go unmentioned in this PhD. 
One of the biggest joy of this PhD was to meet my girlfriend, Mina, who came as a visitor to our logic group.
