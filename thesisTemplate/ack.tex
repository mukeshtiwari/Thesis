This thesis could not have been possible without the support of my supervisor, Dirk Pattinson. I really admire his 
ability to understand the problem, and his intuition to to make sure that I stay clear from many dead ends which 
I would have happily spent months. I wish
I could incorporate more of his qualities, but I believe I have less optimism about my chance.

 I wanted to dedicate this thesis to my first true friend in Australia, Turbo, my house dog who was patient enough to 
 listing my proofs, conjectures and ideas about my PhD, but occasionally  bark if it was too much for him. 
 
 Some of the great friends who made this journey possible are Caitlin, Milad, Mina, Jim, Ian and Ali, Ahmed. Although, 
 their lunch jokes were too much for me to digest, but I enjoyed it whenever I could.  I learned many valuable things 
 from Micheal during the thesis presentation which helped me shaping my personality and how to present it. 
 
 I want to thank Thomas Haines for teaching me all the bits pieces of zero knowledge proofs and cryptography. I really 
 enjoyed working with him. One of the best experience of this PhD was travelling to Princeton to participate in summer. 
 Unfortunately, I could not attend Marktoberdorf because it was impossible for me to get the visa of Germany, but I hope
 things would be more easier in the upcoming future. 
 
 Last and above all, I want to thank Mina. Being by your side for the last two years has been the best thing that ever happened to me, and I could not 
 imagine life without you.   I am also grateful to all the efforts you made to bear my tendencies to constantly
  talk about set-theory/formal-verification/every-thing-except-romantic.
 Write in this order.

 Last, but not least, the good wine and beer of Australia could not go unmentioned in this PhD. 
One of the biggest joy of this PhD was to meet my girlfriend, Mina, who came as a visitor to our logic group.
