This thesis builds on and contributes to work in the areas of electronic voting. 
The original contribution of my thesis is achieving correctness, privacy and verifiability in 
electronic voting. Although studies in electronic voting has examined verifiability and correctness, 
there has not been privacy.   As such, this study provides additional insight into correctness with 
emphasis on verifiability by generating a proof certificate (additional piece of data for auditing) . 
This study is important to my discipline because it bridges the gap between electronic voting 
and paper ballot election. But what excites me the most about this study is making the democracy accessible to everyone
and making there voice heard.
